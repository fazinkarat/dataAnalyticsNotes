Data Ecosystem


Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find 
answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources

data analysis is the collection, transformation, 
and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, 
make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. 
Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data. 
It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.

Subject matter experts



• What kind of results are needed?
• Who will be informed?
• Am I answering the question being asked?
• How quickly does a decision need to be made?

Data-driven decision-making is essential for analysts, but gut instinct can also play a role in identifying patterns and connections. Balancing data and gut instinct is crucial for making informed decisions, and the right mix depends on the project's goals and time constraints.
