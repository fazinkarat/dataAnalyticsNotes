The beauty of dashboards
The following table summarizes the benefits of using a dashboard for both data analysts and their stakeholders.
Benefits	For data analysts	
		For stakeholders
		
Centralization	Share a single source of data with all stakeholders	Work with a comprehensive view of data, initiatives, objectives, projects, processes, and more
Visualization	Show and update live, incoming data in real time*	Spot changing trends and patterns more quickly
Insightfulness	Pull relevant information from different datasets	Understand the story behind the numbers to keep track of goals and make data-driven decisions

Tableau 
There are many different visualization tools available. One of the most powerful is Tableau, which supports a range of data sources and has advanced analytics capabilities that allow for in-depth exploration of data trends and patterns. Tableau can handle more data and larger datasets than many other tools and offers real-time data availability. 
It does take some time to learn to use Tableau, but your efforts can be well-rewarded, as Tableau visualizations are pleasantly interactive. For a dashboard to be successful, it needs to engage users and help them learn. Tableau has put in a lot of effort to ensure that its users have a great experience and the platform is accessible to everyone.
