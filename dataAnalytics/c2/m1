For instance, if you have a conversation with someone who works in retail, you might lead with questions like

• collect, and how do you use it?
• Measurable: Do you know what percentage of sales is from your top-selling products?
• Action-oriented: Are there business decisions or changes that you would make if you had the right information? For example, if you had information about how umbrella sales change with the weather, how would you use it?
• Relevant: How often do you review data from your business?
• Time-bound: Can you describe how data helped you make good decisions for your store(s) this past year?

• Measurable: How well do student benchmark test scores correlate with their grades?
• Action-oriented: Do you share your data with other teachers to improve lessons?
• Relevant: Have you shared grading data with an entire class? If so, do students seem to be more or less motivated, or about the same?

• Relevant: How do you advertise to or communicate with customers?
• Time-bound: What does your year-over-year sales growth look like for the last three years?
